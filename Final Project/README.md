**Purpose:**
First Chrome Extension! As CS majors, our extensive unending research usually results in too many tabs being opened in one window. This simple & straightforward extension allows for convenient navigation between those tabs.

Built with [Chrome Extensions API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide) supported using JavaScript, HTML, CSS
